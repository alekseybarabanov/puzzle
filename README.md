## Puzzle assembler

This is a pet project for the author to demonstrate developer skills and 
is intended to play in some future a role of the reference book of 
technologies the author has dealt with.

Puzzle consists of square puzzle pieces. Each piece has got a colored circle part (either 1/3 or 2/3) on each side.

The aim of the puzzle is to assemble a map (N pieces in a row, K pieces in a column) where all balls are consistent. 

See the assembled example below with 3x3 puzzle map.
