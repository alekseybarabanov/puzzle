## Puzzle assembler

This project is a pet project for the author to demonstrate developer skills and plays a role of the reference book of 
technologies the author has dealt with.

Puzzle consists of square puzzle pieces. Each piece has got a part (either 1/3 or 2/3) of a colored ball on each side. 
The aim of the puzzle
is to assemble a map (N pieces in a row, K pieces in a column). See the assembled example below with 3x3 puzzle map.
